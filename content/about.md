# About

I'm John Misczak and this is my blog where I (infrequently) write about some stuff I'm working on or topics I'm currently learning about. 

I currently work in cloud security, helping secure applications and services across AWS, Azure, and GCP. Outside of work, I spend most of my time with my kids - but when they're otherwise busy or asleep, I can usually be found out running or tinkering with my homelab setup.
